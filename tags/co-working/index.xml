      <description>Our last co-working space that we tried out was The Loft, which had set the bar a little high since I was genuinely impressed with it.
Although I was quite happy with it, the parking around The Loft was quite pricy for a 8 hour stay. I could easily be paying around 200 to 300 pesos a day just for the parking.
So, while looking for a new place to eat, we stumbled across WeRemote which is located at Metrowalk, a sort-of establishment/center that had a huge free parking lot as long as you were a customer of Metrowalk&amp;rsquo;s tenants.</description>

      <description>After trying out ASPACE, we searched for a co-working space outside of Makati for a change. Our current scrum master decided to checkout Loft, and man was it way better than the previous co-working space we went to.
Like what I did before, let&amp;rsquo;s drill it down from what&amp;rsquo;s good to what&amp;rsquo;s bad.
The Good Fast Internet. Unlike ASpace, Loft had decent internet speed. The average internet speed is around the border of 40Mbps, which is 8 times faster than ASpace&amp;rsquo;s internet speed!</description>

      <description>Working remotely could get boring at times, and if you have colleagues working around the same area as you, you might opt to meetup face to face just to have a real human to talk to in person.
For college kids back when I was still part of that age group, the usual goto place would be coffee shops. But now, we got co-working spaces littered everywhere that usually have unlimited coffee!</description>
