    <h1 class="title">The almost perfect co-working space - WeRemote</h1>
      
    <div class="content">
      

<p>Our last co-working space that we tried out was <a href="https://blog.danielcefram.com/co-working-at-the-loft/" target="_blank">The Loft</a>, which had set the bar a little high since I was genuinely impressed with it.</p>

<p>Although I was quite happy with it, the parking around The Loft was quite pricy for a 8 hour stay. I could easily be paying around 200 to 300 pesos a day just for the parking.</p>

<p>So, while looking for a new place to eat, we stumbled across <a href="https://weremote.com" target="_blank">WeRemote</a> which is located at Metrowalk, a sort-of establishment/center that had a huge free parking lot as long as you were a customer of Metrowalk&rsquo;s tenants.</p>

<p>The pricing was quite attractive, albeit was VAT exclusive. A 24 hour pass would cost you 550 pesos + 12% VAT. That&rsquo;s almost 50 pesos pricier than The Loft&hellip; But if you consider the parking fee, that&rsquo;s 100 pesos ~ 200 pesos cheaper :D</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s break down our review from the Good to what&rsquo;s iffy.</p>

<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>

<p><strong>Free Parking.</strong> As I&rsquo;ve already mentioned earlier, establishments located in Metrowalk enjoy the center&rsquo;s free parking for their clients&hellip; and Metrowalk&rsquo;s parking is HUGE. Most of Metrowalk&rsquo;s clients are restaurants and bars, which means that the parkings only get crammed during the night after work. So, if you&rsquo;re working schedule is early to mid shift, you&rsquo;ll be in luck since you have the whole parking lot for you to pick.</p>

<p><strong>Location.</strong> Being at Metrowalk, you would also have access to the restaurants in the center. A couple of minutes walk could also take you to the nearby malls, like the Podium, Robinsons Galleria, and Ayala 30th.</p>

<p>What this means is that you won&rsquo;t get hungry as long as you have the money to spend :D</p>

<p><strong>The Chairs.</strong> Finally, a co-working space that got this right. The previous 2 co-working space had hard seats, which wasn&rsquo;t comfortable to sit on if you plan on working for more than 4 hours straight. In WeRemote, they provide computer/office chairs, specifically designed to be sat on for long hours. This is a big deal as you would most likely concentrate on your hustle rather than your butt.</p>

<p><strong>The Vibe.</strong> As with The Loft, the Vibe <strong>inside</strong> WeRemote is great. It&rsquo;s creative, sufficiently lit, and comfortable. They have multiple areas to work, if in case the computer chairs isn&rsquo;t your thing, and you prefer a coffee-shop-esque feel.</p>

<p>They even have rooms for trainings!</p>

        </span></p>
    



<p>They have meeting rooms, but I wasn&rsquo;t able to take pictures of them. You could check some photos on <a href="https://weremote.com/amazing-amenities/" target="_blank">their website</a> though.</p>

<p><strong>Utilities.</strong> Comfort rooms are as clean as in The Loft, and they even have shower rooms.</p>

<p>And as the usual, they have free coffee and water. An extra though is that they have a paid food corner at the front desk, if ever you need a bag of chips, coke, or energy drinks. I usually take a red bull a day after lunch when sleepiness kicks in :D</p>

<p><strong>The Staff.</strong> The staff and guards were friendly and generally helpful. I&rsquo;d give them 5 out of 5 stars if I had to rate them.</p>

<p>The coffee machine&rsquo;s acting up? They&rsquo;ll immediately try to fix it.</p>

<p>The room is a little hot? They&rsquo;ll assist you, and if it isn&rsquo;t technically possible to fix right away, they&rsquo;ll suggest you to move to a colder room.</p>

<h3 id="the-meh">The Meh</h3>

<p><strong>Internet.</strong> When I first tried it out, I was greatly impressed, seeing speeds up to 60Mbps! I was so impressed that I even shelled out my own money to work there an extra day a week.</p>

<p>However, as time went by, I encountered several instances that their internet connection would go down. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind had it went down like only once in 3 months of my stay there, considering that we only go to the co-working space once a week.</p>

<p>But it was several times that the internet went down. There were even times that the internet connection was so flakey that I couldn&rsquo;t even get any work done. It&rsquo;s also very iffy that I got disconnected multiple times in my remote call with my employer.</p>

<p>The internet connection became better for the last few meetings we had in WeRemote, but the previous experiences did make a mark which is why I&rsquo;m putting this in <strong>the meh</strong> category.</p>

<p><strong>Booking System.</strong> Unlike in The Loft, where you can book a co-working pass through their website, WeRemote, as of now, does not have such a system. Previously, when they did not have a 24-hour staff at the front desk, it was very troublesome if you went in early and wanted to avail a 24 hour pass. You had to book your 24-hour pass at least a day before to avoid any hassle just in case you came in earlier than the front desk staff.</p>

<p>This has been sort of resolved right now as they now have staff at the front desk at any time of the day, but I&rsquo;d still prefer booking a pass online, and paying through my credit card or PayPal. As I usually transact using my card nowadays, I generally do not bring a lot of cash with me.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad">The bad</h3>

<p><strong>Air-condition.</strong> Just like the internet connection, there were multiple times that it was just too hot in the main co-working space. I don&rsquo;t think this has been solved yet, although it&rsquo;s the rainy season right now, so you wouldn&rsquo;t notice the heat as much as a few months back during summer.</p>

<p>To be fair, the staff did suggest to us to move to the smaller room, where they had dedicated air-conditioning. It was pretty cold there, so that was a good thing :) But still, if I am to rate this space objectively, the air-conditioning facility isn&rsquo;t stable enough to serve many co-working clients at the same time.</p>

<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a possibility that this has been fixed by the time you&rsquo;re reading this. But as of our last stay at WeRemote last week, it wasn&rsquo;t satisfactory.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>I would definitely recommend WeRemote. I recommended this to a friend who is working on a startup, as the area is really good and if he did get a private office space at WeRemote, he would generally not experience the air-condition issue. Hopefully, the internet connection stays stable as how it was on our previous 6 weeks, and this would definitely be a great space to work on.</p>

<p>So, considering that I also recommended The Loft, which is just a few blocks away, you might be wondering which to pick. If I was to pick, I&rsquo;d still choose WeRemote, as the 200 pesos - 300 pesos for a 8 hour parking is too steep for me (<em>what if you wanted to stay more than 8 hours? The paid parking price would grow by the hour</em>). The chairs are also generally better in WeRemote, which you would definitely appreciate if you&rsquo;re going to be working for long hours there.</p>

<p>But if you&rsquo;re going here by commute, I&rsquo;d suggest The Loft as it&rsquo;s cheaper by almost 50. And if you work at nights, the price would be cheaper by almost 150 compared to WeRemote.</p>

<p>The facilities are comparable, along with their internet speeds, which is the primary aspect to consider when choosing a space, thus the deciding factor would be the price&hellip; and if chairs are important to you, or the air-conditioning :D</p>
